                		In a blogpost titled “When Are We Gonna Have a Serious Conversation About How Unserious (and Problematic) SIGCSE Is?”, Dr. Nicki Washington uses a review given to her by the Special Interest Group in Computer Science Education Technical Symposium to demonstrate the issues perpetuating the computer science community, specifically regarding elitism and racism. Washington walks through various criticisms of her proposal to the 2023 SIGCE panel, refuting them along the way. She gave little information regarding the contents of her proposal, which makes it difficult to fully analyze the criticisms in context. I’ve heard very little else about discrimination in SIGCE and more generally the field of computer science. That being said, computer science seems like a field of work and study that could easily be permeated with racism and elitism, given that it has historically been reserved for more wealthy people who can afford the necessary technology, and issues of classism and racism are often very closely tied together. Washington’s extremely well-structured rebuttal begins with a “relevance and interest” section, where she details the reviewer notes she received on these subjects. Specifically, the notes say that the proposal doesn’t explicitly mention a benefit to the community, but can instead be inferred, and because the panelists’ responses aren’t included in the proposal, it’s difficult to assess the relevance of the panel. Washington responded to these criticisms by including the portion of the proposal where community benefits are included and arguing that the two pages that were allotted for the proposal weren’t nearly enough to include panelist responses. The first note doesn’t seem like a terribly harsh criticism, and I would be shocked if it carried any real weight when the decision to reject the panel was made. I’m curious to read other rejected and accepted proposals. Specifically, I would like to see if panelist responses are generally included. If they are omitted from accepted proposals, this would show clear unfairness and inequality. I agree with Washington that two pages is extremely limiting and the responses shouldn’t be necessary in the panel proposals. That being said, if they are required in order to accept proposals, and this can be demonstrated in past accepted and rejected proposals, she has no basis to use this as evidence of an unjust rejection. The next reviewer note states that there is no indication of whether the panel could work in hybrid format, although it then includes that slight adjustments could be made to fix this, suggesting that this criticism played little role in the ultimate rejection. Under the section of “panelist/presenter considerations”, a reviewer argues that it’s difficult to know how technically deep each of the presenters are due to some of them not being full-time tenure track faculty. This is an unfair criticism and demonstrates elitism. Washington herself had been offered tenure track positions, but declined. Additionally, it would be single minded and limiting to only consider the opinions of people who hold these certain specific jobs. It would be significantly easier to hold people accountable for outdated and unjust views if these reviewers were not left anonymous. I believe it would lead to more complete and fair acceptance/rejection panel decisions. After some seemingly trivial grammatical critiques and responses, we’re given the “overall evaluation”, which summarizes the rejection. In this section, it’s stated that there is not enough supporting literature, discussion of benefits to the wider community, and clear relevance given the panelists’ backgrounds and lack of panelist responses. <strong> To conclude, I believe that this blogpost is lacking a lot of information and context that would be necessary to fully analyze the situation, including the proposal itself, past accepted and rejected proposals, and the full rejection letter. That being said, computer science seems like a field that could very easily be laced with elitism and racism, and the current system that has reviewers decide a panel’s fate anonymously allows for injustice. </strong> Additionally, in times of unsurety, I believe that it is necessary to side with the one claiming oppression.
