              In June of 2022, the United States Justice Department reached a settlement with Meta Platforms regarding discrimination within the organization’s system for advertising housing. The Justice Department originally sued Meta, which was formerly known as Facebook, in March of 2019, accusing them of utilizing race, religion, disability, and familial status, among other characteristics, in their machine learning algorithms that decide which housing options will be advertised to users. The Fair Housing Act, or FHA, was instituted in 1968, and prohibited discrimination against certain classes during the process of renting or buying a home and the similar processes that are associated with housing. The Justice Department alleged that many of these protected classes were being used by Facebook to determine housing advertisements, and in this process, people were being denied housing options based on their backgrounds. Facebook was clearly violating the Fair Housing Act, and the consequences they received during the settlement, including a maximum civil penalty fine of 115,054 dollars, were entirely just. This is to say the least; I would argue that the punishments given to Meta Platforms were not nearly severe enough. It’s possible to see some benefits associated with using these, and other personal data, to cater advertisements towards a certain individual. By providing you with options that a highly accurate algorithm predicts most match your preferences and interest, the organization can cut down on the amount of time you would otherwise have had to spend looking for your perfect match, and can help you find options you wouldn’t have been able to find on your own. It would be very easy for this process to be used with malicious intent, though, and could cause immense harm to communities and lead to segregation. The Department of Housing and Urban Development said that advertisers could determine housing advertisements based on ZIP code, which basically meant "drawing a red line around those neighborhoods on a map." The term, “redlining”, originated following the programs associated with the 1930s-era New Deal, which allowed the government to decide whether or not to give mortgage loans to people based on a map which ranked communities from least risky to most risky. This isolated poor communities and the people who resided within them from the wealthier neighborhoods, which led to segregation because most black communities were labeled highly risky. Because of this, I agree with the Department of Housing and Urban Development that these personal characteristics should never be considered during processes associated with providing people housing, and those who don’t listen should be punished heavily. Because of this, I believe that the Justice Department should have punished Meta more severely; the agreement they settled on seems to be no more than a simple slap on the wrist. Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Meta Platforms, has a net worth of nearly 80 billion dollars, making the monetary fine of 115,054 dollars seem like a drop in the ocean. Additionally, the other punishments did little more than require that Meta change their housing advertising system.
