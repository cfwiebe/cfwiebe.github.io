                	In “We Need To Fix Black Hair in Video Games”, a YouTube video posted by The Blessing Show, Blessing Adeoye Jr. details the struggles black people continue to face regarding hair representation in video games. Specifically, he shows, with the anecdotal help of a friend and the apt expertise of a video game designer, that black people have historically been discriminated against based on their natural hair, and this unfairness can be found in the lack of realistic options for black hair during character customization in most video games. Although video game graphics continue to progress in nearly every sense, options for black users when designing characters remain highly limited and, in many cases, unrealistic. This discrepancy between options for black and white video game players is likely in part a reflection of a lack of diversity within the software developing and, more broadly, the computer science community. Video game development companies need to promote inclusivity and diversity in every aspect of their brands, but especially within their design teams. This seems like something that should be able to go unsaid. Only once there is diversity within all video game design teams can equal and accurate representation for all peoples be reflected in character designs. This is easier said than done, however, given that many game developing companies are based in Japan, an extremely racially homogenous country. This shouldn’t be an excuse for isolating specific groups of people, though, and these companies must work hard to at least receive input from all ethnicities and racial groups. Additionally, the lack of options for black hair designs that is found throughout the gaming community shows the general lack of awareness for African heritage and culture. I believe that it is important that all peoples recognize and respect each other as well as the aspects that make them each unique. The fact that this problem continues to exist despite continuous video game advancements in all other senses shows that either recognition or respect for this specific piece of black culture is missing, and must be fixed immediately. Many players customize their avatars to look as similar to themselves as possible. This makes it easier to become fully engrossed in the game and feel as though you yourself are experiencing it, rather than simply controlling a character from the outside. When black users are designing their characters after themselves and find no hair options even similar to their own, it detracts from the gaming experience. It’s unfair that video game players of lighter complexions should be able to enjoy gaming more, and is a seemingly simple fix. It’s extremely important that game developing companies begin working harder to promote inclusivity within their work spaces. It’s also important that the players themselves continue to complain about these issues, given that companies don’t necessarily have malicious intentions in these cases, and often, are simply ignorant. Feedback is needed in order to educate these people, which will lead to progress when it comes to representation and inclusion.
