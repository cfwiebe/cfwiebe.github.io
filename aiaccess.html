                		In “How AI Is Improving Accessibility”, Malini Boorgu describes how artificial intelligence is now being used to increase neurodivergent inclusivity in both the classroom and the workplace. Neurodivergent people, a label which encompasses people with ADHD and autism among other conditions, have historically been misrepresented and unfairly treated. By using such technological advancements as text to speech and image to speech in classrooms, we can target this inequality early in students’ lives, and can level the playing field before it begins to separate. This isn’t the only place where image to speech artificial intelligence is being used to break barriers. Since 2016, Facebook has used this technology to allow people with visual imparities to participate along with everyone else. Moving into the workplace, artificial intelligence can be used to summarize and break down large bodies of text that on their own can be extremely difficult to focus on and process for some neurodivergent people. This will not only lead to improved inclusivity for these people at their jobs, but it will increase workplace productivity overall. With these new technologies comes the risk of them being misused by the wrong people, however. This has recently been seen in how artificial intelligence such as ChatGPT has been used to take large quantities of inputted information and text, and output a complete summarized essay. Specifically, this has been used by students to produce completed homework assignments and cheat without doing any real work of their own. It’s unclear whether this technology was invented for this purpose or whether the creator had good intentions and it merely is now being utilized in this unethical way. It proves, however, how dangerous artificial intelligence has the potential to be, and how closely it must be regulated. Despite these risks, artificial intelligence created in order to aid neurodivergent people in the classroom and workplace has allowed our society to make significant steps towards complete inclusivity for all people. They also sparked a movement to more thoroughly appreciate the unique set of skills and abilities that are held by many neurodivergent people. Specifically, once companies incorporated technologies to better include these people, they found that they outperformed their neurotypical coworkers in many fields, including pattern recognition, mathematics, and information processing, as well as in jobs that require repetitive work which causes burnout in many workers. In response to this discovery and the decline in workers willing to complete these jobs, workforces have been created that are specifically focused on hiring neurodivergent workers. This has proved to be excellent for the neurodivergent community, especially because most hiring processes often exclude or ignore these people. Additionally, facial recognition will continue to make logging in a significantly simpler and easier process, and astonishingly, artificial intelligence has become four times better at lip reading than the world’s top experts. Both of these technological advancements will aid people with hearing, speaking, and typing disabilities. Finally, artificial intelligence has begun to allow real time translation between languages, and this technology will only continue to improve. This will knock down the language barriers that cause problems across the globe, and will allow for improved efficiency in the classroom and workplace.
