                	In “The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas”, an excerpt from The Wind’s Twelve Quarters, written by Ursula K LeGuin, a fantastical and idyllic city named Omelas is described. In forcing the reader to compare Omelas to their own world, LeGuin makes many important commentaries on the nature of humanity, and posits that even in a utopian society, happiness cannot possibly come without hidden consequences and pain.
The first major portion of the story details just what makes Omelas so perfect, including a joyous parade filled with extravagant clothing, beautiful song, and lovely weather. LeGuin establishes at several points throughout the story that the happiness felt by the citizens is not simply dumb joy, and that the instinct of the reader might be to distrust a story of pure happiness without flaw. Rather, the citizens of Omelas are intelligent folk and no less complex than common humans. In making this point clear, LeGuin makes it easier for the reader to connect Omelas to Earth and understand the symbolic messages and analogies strewn throughout. She also does it in order to make the reader question why intelligence and misery are so commonly tied together. Is the reality of humanity and life on Earth so hopeless that only the naive and ignorant can be truly happy? LeGuin writes the story directly to the reader, and allows for imagination to decide any further details that improve the city, possibly including euphoric drugs, beer, and free sex. In doing so, she establishes that happiness is subjective, and the things that bring joy vary from person to person.
Once LeGuin adequately ensures that the reader understands how joyous of a place Omelas is, she confirms that the original instinct of the reader to believe that this utopia can’t exist without a negative side was correct. She details a tiny, locked room in which an undefined child sits in their own filth and exists in a constant state of desolation and misery. LeGuin continues without explanation that this child must live like this in order to ensure that all other residents of Omelas are happy and satisfied. Moreover, all citizens of Omelas are aware of this child and the life they live, as well as the reason why they must live that way. While some of these people ultimately leave the city as a result of this knowledge, most stay and remain happy in spite of this child’s despair. The main point of the story and many philosophical questions can be drawn from this portion: happiness cannot possibly exist without someone else’s misfortune; this balance is the natural state of society. Moreover, is it ethical to live happily whilst ignoring the human beings hurt in the process of getting that happiness to you? Do all happy people have a moral responsibility to either give up their happiness or help those less fortunate than themselves? More broadly, is Omelas an ethical place? How many happy lives are worth being sacrificed in order to save one sad life? Surely not the entirety of Omelas.
